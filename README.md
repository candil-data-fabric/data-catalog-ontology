# Data Catalog Ontology

## Purpose and Scope

This ontology provides a representation of the Data Catalog used by the CANDIL Data Fabric. The ontology reuses existing ontologies such as DCAT, ORG or DCTERMS and extends them with the concept of an NGSI-LD Context Broker as a data source.

## Vocabulary Development

This ontology is developed following the guidelines of the [LOT methodology](https://lot.linkeddata.es).

### Requirements

The requirements of this ontology are written as competency questions/natural language statements, which have been captured in a [CSV file](./requirements/requirements.csv).

### Ontology Model

The following diagrams shows the classes and properties defined in the ontology. The diagram follows the [Chowlk notation](https://chowlk.linkeddata.es/notation.html).

### Ontology Code (OWL)

The OWL code of the ontology, serialized in Turtle format, is available [here](./ontology/ontology.ttl).

### Examples

Sample RDF datasets are provided in the [examples folder](./examples/).

### Evaluation

This ontology is evaluated using the following tools:
- [OOPS](https://oops.linkeddata.es)
- [FOOPS](https://foops.linkeddata.es/FAIR_validator.html)
- SPARQL queries

The evaluation reports from OOPS and FOOPS, along with the SPARQL queries, are available in the [evaluation folder](./evaluation/).

### Documentation

The ontology documentation was generated using the WIDOCO tool and published online at: https://w3id.org/yang/server

We encourage to locally develop the ontology documentation before publishing it online. For this, we recommend running WIDOCO tool via Docker container.

To generate the documentation, execute the following command:

```bash
./generate-docs.sh
```
